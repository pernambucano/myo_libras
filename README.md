# Reconhecimento da Língua Brasileira de Sinais usando sensores Eletromiográficos.

Este projeto utiliza os sensores eletromiográficos presentes no Myo Armband para coletar dados de sinais em Libras. Segue-se então a
segmentação e coleta de características a partir dos dados segmentados. Uma matriz de características é criada e utilizada para o 
treinamento e classificação utilizando Random Forest e Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation.
